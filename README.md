# WillOfTheWispsTAS
TAS tools for WOTW.

# NOTE: ONLY WORKS ON CURRENT PATCH.

To use the tool, run WOTW.TAS.Injector.exe after running the game executable, make sure WOTW.TAS.dll is in the same directory as the injector executable. You will need to run the injector (and possibly the game) as administrator.

Note: inject once you are in main menu, otherwise issues can arise with pointers being grabbed too early.
(I can fix this but it wasn't priority atm)

Run Buggy.exe to for overlay display of commands being executed, and to show Position\Speed\Cursor pos, etc.

Hotkeys are not configurable atm.

For playback, create a file called Ori.rec in the directory where oriwotw.exe is located.

Hotkeys are basic:

F1 - To pause\unpause

F4 - Toggle playback, read from Ori.rec in the directory where the game executable is located.

F9 - Toggle display of in-game OSD (this is the alternative to Buggy)

Middle mouse click to move top left corner of OSD to cursor location in-game.

[ - To step one frame (this also reloads the input file so you can make changes to the inputs while framestepping.)<br/>
Note: It won't understep (e.g go backwards and redo) you can only edit a current input or inputs currently not being
      played back.
