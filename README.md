# WillOfTheWispsTAS
TAS tools for WOTW.

# NOTE: ONLY WORKS ON CURRENT PATCH.

To use the tool, run WOTW.TAS.Injector.exe after running the game executable, make sure WOTW.TAS.dll is in the same directory as the injector executable. You will need to run the injector (and possibly the game) as administrator.

Note: inject once you are in main menu, otherwise issues can arise with pointers being grabbed too early.
(I can fix this but it wasn't priority atm)

Run Buggy.exe to for overlay display of commands being executed, and to show Position\Speed\Cursor pos, etc.

Hotkeys aren't configurable, input file is created for you if it does not exist.

In the directory where the game executable is, you can create it however if you want, it looks for Ori.rec.

Hotkeys are basic:

F1 - to pause\start framestep.

F4 - start playback, read from Ori.rec in the directory where the game executable is located.

--------------------------------------------------------

[ - To step one frame (this also reloads the input file so you can make changes to the inputs while framestepping.)<br/>
Note: It won't understep (e.g go backwards and redo) you can only edit a current input or inputs currently not being
      played back.


--------------------------------------------------------
